      "A visa is a temporary permit that allows you to enter and stay in the UK for a specific period. It is usually granted for a limited time and requires you to leave the UK before the visa expires. On the other hand, residency is a longer-term status that allows you to live and work in the UK for an extended period. Residency can be granted for different durations, such as indefinite leave to remain (ILR) or permanent residency. The residency application process is more complex and requires meeting specific criteria, such as having a job offer or a family member in the UK.",
